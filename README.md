# SE3355FinalProject

I made a car rental web application.
I used html css and javascript.
There is an automatic login in the system. With it, you can log in and see the page with the tools.
If there is no login, when we register with a new registration, if there is no problem with the registration, the registration name is displayed in the message and goes to the page with the vehicles.
I have my vehicles on my Car.html page. I created detail pages for each vehicle there. When you click on the button, it gives you detailed information on a new html page.
